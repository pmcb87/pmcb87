Hello, I'm Patrick!

After completing Flatiron Academy Cybersecurity Analytics Bootcamp, I wanted to create a repository for what I have been working on.

I am determined to continue to increase my skills while I am job hunting and am happy to find that I am still enthusiastic and passionate about security.

I have found that installing and configuring different applications and doing CTFs have helped keep my Linux skills sharp.

I did web and graphic design as a hobby previously and in the bootcamp was exposed to Python and Bash, which I am going to continue to learn 
and do personal projects.
